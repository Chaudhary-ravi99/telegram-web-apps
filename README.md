# Telegram Web Apps ‚ûú ***[@pytba_web_app_bot](https://t.me/pytba_web_app_bot/)***

This is a collection of some Web Apps that I designed for Telegram.

All the Web Apps are designed using **[pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI)**.

## List of Web Apps included here:

  - **Demo Forms** : An easy way to collect inputs from users supporting a lot of input types (dates, files, etc.)
    
  - **CAPTCHA** : An simple verification system to keep spammers away!

  - **re-CAPTCHA** : Google's re-CAPTCHA system integrated within Telegram to filter unwanted spammers. This can be implemented within large groups.

  - **QR-Code** : A built in QR Code scanner within Telegram.

The main purpose for this project is to help new-comers to start designing their own Mini Apps!
